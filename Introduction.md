# Introduction

![](image1.jpeg)

I am a computer science major. I have taken Computer Science I (AP
Computer Science A in high school), Computer Science II: Data
Structures, Computer Science III, Assembly Language and Computer
Architecture, Operating Systems I, Software Engineering, Discrete and
Continuous Computer Algorithms, Web Page Design, Introduction to Data
Science, Language Processing, and Introduction to Cybersecurity. I've
written a Bank Simulation program in Java and a program in Python where
I found trends in data using machine learning techniques. I have also
made simple web pages including a web page that contains a game called
"Game of 8" and a web page for a hotel chain with 5 different pages. I
have also collaborated on a project with 3 other students to create a
reference library using Java GUI.

I see myself using what we learn in this course to create projects
outside of the class. I also see myself using what we learn to obtain a
job once I graduate as many jobs are looking for people with experience
in web development.
